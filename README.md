  Hello there!  Thank you for checking out my project.  It may be just a crappy version of Space Invaders copied in Unity, but I appreciate the time you took to check it out :)
  In the .rar file you wil find a copy of the already finished game(Space Inavders.exe) and a copy of the folder with all the project   assets.  I included these in case you wanted to open the project in Unity yourself and check it out.  I made this is Unity 5.5.2f1 so don't try and open it with Unity 5.6.
  If you make any changes to the game(improvements, sprite changes, code changes, etc) please link back to this project as your base.  I included this here as something open source that people could use as a base and improve off of it.  I would like some recognizition for that at the very least.
  Again, thank you for checking out my project.  Even with all the hours spent bug fixing and everything, it was still a blast to make and I'm proud of it in the end.  I'm a beginner Unity user and this was my first project.  I'm hoping to do many more in the future, I've already started to work on my second!
Enjoy! ~Bostonian02
